<strong>Maven is an interactive virtual community for LGBTQA youth to network, organize and educate for social change.</strong>

Through social gaming, Maven provides Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Ally youth with training, resources and leadership opportunities.  By utilizing a platform that enhances youth engagement, youth will get connected to other LGBTQA youth and community based organizations who serve queer youth.
